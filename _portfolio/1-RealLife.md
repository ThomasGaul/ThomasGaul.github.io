This project currently aims to extend the definitions of autopoiesis in the Game of Life (GoL) to Larger than Life (LtL), in order to take a limit as LtL rules approach an infinite neighborhood size (RealLife). Once we have definitions for RealLife, we can analyse the structure of *dependency manifolds* (autopoietic networks) and *interaction manifolds* (map of an individuals responses to perturbations). This requires the development of mathematical tools to analyse autopoiesis in continuous space, thus providing future investigations into more realistic systems with more rigorous tools and theoretical insights.

With this, many further questions can be pursued: the necessity of adaptivity, the relation between operational and physical boundaries, structural coupling, the origins of autopoietic systems, the consequences of structural degeneracy, how the viability constraint relates to the autopoietic organization, among many others.
