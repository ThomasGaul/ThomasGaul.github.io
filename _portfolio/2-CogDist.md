This project aims to develop a more rigorous method of cognitive descrption that avoids the anthropocentricism implicit in natural language. I have proposed that by focusing on a concept I call *cognitive distinctions*, we can construct representations of an agent's behaviour that are more consonant with that agent's *perspective*. I have further proposed a graph theoretic formalism as a preliminary method to construct these descriptions from times series of a minimally cognitive model agent. Beyond this, an exploration of other formalisms would certainly be profitable. At the very least, the concept of cognitive distinctions can provide a certain framework in which to consider the relation between an agent's perspective and our own such that we may avoid making epistemological errors in cognitive science.
