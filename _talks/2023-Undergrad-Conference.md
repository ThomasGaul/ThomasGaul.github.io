This is a presentation I gave at the *Fifteenth Annual Midwest Undergraduate Cognitive Science Conference* on early results of my referential communication project. None of these results ended up being relevant to the final paper (the direction changed drastically a couple months after the conference). This was also my first conference presentation.
