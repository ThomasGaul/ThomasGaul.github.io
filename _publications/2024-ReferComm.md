An analysis of the kinds of language we use in scientific practice is critical to developing a more rigorous and sound methodology. This article argues that the methods of description commonly employed in cognitive science risk obscuring important features of an agent's cognition. We propose an alternative method to alleviate this problem, wherein the concept of <i>cognitive distinctions</i> plays a central role. A model of referential communication is developed and analysed as a platform to compare the ordinary method of description with description by cognitive distinctions. We demonstrate that the ordinary method fails to adequately capture an agent's perspective, whereas cognitive distinctions in a graph-theoretic formalism are, in contrast, capable of reflecting that perspective. We then consider how different methods of description relate to one another in a broader methodological framework. Finally, we explore the consequences of, and challenges for, cognitive distinctions.
