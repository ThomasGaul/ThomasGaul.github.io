Hello, this is my website. I keep a list of my publications and my CV on here. I might also post less formal thoughts on whatever  interests me.

I am an undergraduate student studying Cognitive Science and Microbiology at Indiana University Bloomington. My current research interests are in developing a formal theory of biological organization and how it relates to cognition, using the concept of *autopoiesis* originally developed by Maturana and Varela. Much of biology takes the existence of organisms for granted without specifying what an organism actually is. When this question is addressed directly, the answers are unsatisfying: either a list of components or a list of properties. The former fails because we can kill organisms without fundamentally changing their molecular composition (heatshock or centrifugation of bacteria). The latter fails because the contexts in which an organism is situated (historical, ecological, species, etc.) are not the same as the organism itself. What is needed is an account of how physical components are *organized* such that the phenomenology of living systems is generated when that organization is realised. Thus, my work aims to mathematically define this organization and formally derive its consequences such that we have a platform on which to develop a rigorous theory of how an organism maintain itself and interact with its environment.

Recently, I have been building off of Randall Beer's previous work analysing the autopoiesis of glider's in Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton. Specifically, I am working towards scaling that analysis to RealLife Euclidean automata, a continuous-space and discrete-time universe. This will hopefully lead to a rigorous theory of autopoiesis in continuous space -- bringing us closer to a theory of autopoiesis in *our* universe.

My other interests include formalisms in other sciences (chemistry, cognitive science, etc.), epistemology, philosophy of science, Wittgenstein, Buddhist philosophy,  and the ethical implications of autonomy.

Feel free to reach out through any of my contacts on the sidebar (preferably email, though).
