Hello, this is my website. I am an undergraduate student studying Cognitive Science and Microbiology at Indiana University Bloomington. I am also part of the Computational Neuroethology Lab. I keep a list of my publications and information about my research on here. In the future, I might also post thoughts that do not quite fit into a paper.

My current research interests are in developing a formal theory of biological organization and how it relates to cognition. Much of biology takes the existence of organisms for granted, without understanding what an organism actually is. When this question is addressed directly, the answers are unsatisfying: either a list of components or a list of properties. The former fails because we can kill organisms without fundamentally changing their molecular composition (e.g., centrifugation of bacteria). The latter fails because it conflates the organism with the contexts in which it is observed (the organism is not its evolutionary history). What is needed is an account of how components are *organized* such that the phenomenology of living systems &mdash; or those systems that we call living &mdash; is generated when that organization is realized in physical space.

The characteristic feature of living systems is their *autonomy*: they are closed networks of processes that continually produce  themselves. The closure of living systems has vast consequences, especially for how we ought to describe them and for how we conceive of biological and cognitive phenomena.

To make these ideas precise, and to contribute to the development of a mathematical biology, we need to analyse simple models of *autopoiesis* &mdash; the continuous self-production of living systems. The recurrent spatio-temporal patterns found in cellular automata have previously been used as such a model (see [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1162/1064546041255539)). My research is currently concerned with extending the theory of autopoiesis developed in cellular automata to Euclidean automata; that is, extending a rigorous theory of autopoiesis to continuous space. Thus, I hope to bring us closer to a mathematical theory of biological organization in our universe.

Other interests of mine include formalisms in other sciences (chemistry, cognitive science, etc.), epistemology, philosophy of science, Buddhist philosophy, Wittgenstein, and the ethical implications of autonomy.

Feel free to reach out through any of my contacts.
